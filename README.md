# Introduction
Firmware for the laser/galvo controller.

# Getting Started
1. Download / clone code 
2. upload using standard Arduino IDE.

# Design Projections
For now we can project a circle using a Look Up table and by computing a circle in real-time by using taylor series approximation.

When you have designed a projection copy the x-y data into static memory of the microcontroller by simply spawning a C array.
